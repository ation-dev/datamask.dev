# Work with us

Datamask is being built in close collaboration with a small number of **design partners**.

If you are responsible for:
- QA or UAT environments  
- test data management  
- data security in non-production systems  
- or developer experience around realistic test data  

we would love to talk.

---

## What it means to be a design partner

Design partners help shape Datamask by:

- sharing real schemas or environments  
- describing how non-production data is used today  
- running early versions of the engine  
- and giving direct feedback on usability and data quality  

In return, you get:
- early access to Datamask  
- influence over its roadmap  
- and a tool shaped around your real workflows  

This is a technical partnership, not a sales process.

---

## What we are looking for

The best design partners are teams that:

- rely on production-like data in QA or UAT  
- have strict security or compliance constraints  
- and are frustrated with copying production data or using unstable synthetic datasets  


---

## How to get in touch

If this resonates, email us at [partners@datamask](mailto:kratika.jain@theation.com) with:

- a short description of your current test-data workflow
- the kind of systems you run
- and what you struggle with today

We will respond immediately.

Datamask is still early, by design.

If you want to help define what safe, reproducible non-production data should look like, this is the right time to be involved.
